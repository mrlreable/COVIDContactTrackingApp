# COVIDContactTrackingApp
This application was made in october 2020 during my 5-th university semester. The main idea was to create an app that has the ability to store contacts and the date of them. Moreover to be able to add, create or delete contact, list all contacts on a given date.
The app was made in the Qt C++ framework and it is a desktop app.
